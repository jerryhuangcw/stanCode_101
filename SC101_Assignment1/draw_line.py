This program creates lines on an instance of GWindow class.
There is a circle indicating the userâ€™s first click. A line appears
at the condition where the circle disappears as the user clicks
on the canvas for the second time.

    This program allows user to draw lines on the window.
    The first click will show a dot on the canvas indicating the starting point of the line.
    The second click will be the end point of the line and will also remove the previous starting dot.
    Line drawing process is repeatable.
